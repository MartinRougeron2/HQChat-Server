// Whether APNs can send, as a function of the environment.
//
// This is the check that decides if a phone ever buzzes, and it had two faults
// that together guaranteed silence on a correctly-configured host:
//
//  1. It ran in EVERY service. `APNS_KEY_P8` is a compose secret mounted into
//     push-bridge alone, so auth and app-api saw `APNS_KEY_ID` + `APNS_TEAM_ID`
//     from the shared server.env, called that partial, and exited. Setting APNs
//     up the documented way made the stack refuse to boot, so the only working
//     configuration was no APNs at all.
//
//  2. It did not look at the topics. `ApnsService.send` returns silently when
//     the platform's topic is unset, so a valid key with no `APNS_TOPIC_IOS`
//     passes every check, authenticates against Apple, and delivers nowhere.
//
// Pure and env-injected on purpose: the real `process.env` is global, and a test
// that mutated it would leak into whichever file ran next.
