// Prekey storage (003_prekeys.sql) — the ephemeral half of the initial key
// agreement. See the migration for why it exists; these tests pin the three
// properties the protocol actually depends on:
//
//   1. a one-time key is claimed EXACTLY once, even when two initiators race —
//      two peers deriving roots from the same "one-time" secret is the whole
//      failure this tier exists to prevent;
//   2. an exhausted pool falls back to the medium-term key rather than failing,
//      so a popular account never becomes unreachable;
//   3. deleting an account leaves no prekey row behind (the account-delete e2e
//      asserts a total purge, and that assertion is App Store evidence).
