//
//   - Anything that used to need a Lua script or a pipeline pretending to be
//     atomic is now a constraint, a single statement, or an explicit
//     transaction. Check-then-set races (username claim, seat cap, invite
//     accept) are gone rather than narrowed.
//   - TTLs are `expires_at` columns. Every read filters on them; sweepExpired()
//     in pg.ts reclaims the space, called on an interval from ops/broker-watch.
//
// MQTT connect token lifetime.
//
// This used to be 5 minutes, and the reason was revocation: with no way to end a
// live session, expiry WAS the revocation mechanism, so it had to be short. The
// cost was that every connected client was disconnected and made to reconnect
// twelve times an hour whether or not it sent anything — a TLS handshake, an
// authn hook call, a store read and a full re-subscribe each time, for every
// client, forever (LAT-1).
//
// `lib/emqx.ts` can now kick a session and drop a single subscription on demand,
// so revocation no longer waits for a clock. The TTL goes back to meaning what a
// credential lifetime should mean: a bound on how long a STOLEN token is useful,
// not a polling interval. Twelve hours keeps a leaked token from being
// indefinite while making the disconnect a daily event rather than a constant one.

// client whose MQTT token expired called /auth/refresh with its session; once the
// session itself lapsed, that 401'd and the app fell back to a full KEM
// handshake, which needs the private key, which prompts. An idle timeout is what
