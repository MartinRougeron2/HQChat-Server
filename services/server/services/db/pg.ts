// The Postgres connection, and the two things every caller needs from it: a
// query helper and a sweeper for the expiring tables.
//
// One pool per process, `max` deliberately small. The managed cluster allows 22
// backend connections (db-s-1vcpu-1gb), which is why the services connect through
// a transaction-mode PgBouncer pool — see infra/database/README.md for the
// budget. A transaction-mode pooler hands a backend to a statement rather than to
// a connection, so a small `max` here is not a throughput ceiling; it is what
// keeps five services inside the budget.
//
// Two consequences of the pooler worth knowing before adding a query:
//   - Session state does not survive between statements. No SET, no LISTEN/
//     NOTIFY, no session-level advisory locks. A multi-statement unit of work
//     must be an explicit transaction on ONE client (see `tx` below).
//   - node-postgres does not use named prepared statements by default, so
//     ordinary parameterised queries are fine. Do not add `name:` to a query.
