// Push-bridge entrypoint (Phase 2 — see deploy/EXTRACTION_PLAN.md).
//
// Subscribes to every conversation topic and fires a CONTENT-FREE APNs wake to
// any conversation member who is currently offline. It sees ciphertext +
// metadata only — never plaintext.
//
// Presence is learned purely over MQTT (no EMQX API key needed): clients publish
// a RETAINED `u/{id}/presence` = {"s":"online"} on connect and set an LWT
// {"s":"offline"} so a drop flips them offline. The bridge tracks this in-memory
// from the `u/+/presence` wildcard (each replica sees all presence). The message
// subscription is SHARED (`$share/…`) so replicas split the fan-in.
//
// ⚠️ This file PARSES topics, which makes it the one service that would keep
// working while being wrong if the topic scheme changed under it. `{id}` here is
// the client id — sha256(hex(pk)), 64 hex characters — and the `online` set,
// `getHashMembers` and `ApnsService.send` are all keyed on that same value.
// Extracting one form and looking up the other would produce a bridge that
// never wakes anybody and never logs an error.
//
// It authenticates to EMQX with the privileged internal credential, which the
// auth server's /mqtt/authn grants superuser (bypassing the per-topic ACL).

// Must be first: importing it loads .env + resolves *_FILE secrets before
// anything reads env. `assertConfig` is called below, once the log sink is up.
