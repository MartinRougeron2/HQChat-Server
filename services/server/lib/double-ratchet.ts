/**
 * KEM double ratchet — the v2 message-key core.
 *
 * Replaces `lib/ratchet.ts`, which is a symmetric ratchet plus an occasional
 * re-key and is deleted once the last caller moves over. Two things were wrong
 * with it, and both are structural rather than bugs:
 *
 *   - Every shared secret was a KEM encapsulation to the peer's LONG-TERM pinned
 *     key. Decapsulation is deterministic, so one leaked identity secret plus a
 *     recorded transcript recomputes every root, chain key and message key that
 *     conversation ever used. Deleting message keys after use bought nothing,
 *     because they were recomputable from ciphertexts the network saw.
 *   - The root did not chain: `deriveEpochRoot(seedA, seedB)` ignored the
 *     previous root, so "epochs" were independent re-keys sitting side by side.
 *
 * Here the root chains, and every step mixes a secret encapsulated to an
 * EPHEMERAL key that is destroyed after use. That is what makes forward secrecy
 * survive an identity compromise and post-compromise security self-heal.
 *
 * This module is pure and KEM-free on purpose: it takes shared secrets the
 * caller already has and returns key material. The HQC calls live in the driver
 * (`ratchetSession`) so these derivations unit-test on any platform and can be
 * pinned byte-for-byte against the Swift twin by `double-ratchet-vectors.json`.
 *
 * ── Why a KEM ratchet is not a DH ratchet transliterated ──────────────────────
 * With Diffie-Hellman both sides compute the same secret from public values, so
 * a header needs only the sender's new public key. With a KEM the ENCAPSULATOR
 * chooses the secret and must transmit a ciphertext for it. So a stepping header
 * carries two things — a fresh public key of the sender's own, and a ciphertext
 * encapsulated to the key the peer most recently advertised:
 *
 *   sender:   (ct, ss) = Encap(peerRkPub);  (root', ck) = rootStep(root, ss)
 *             header = { rk: myNewRkPub, kemCt: ct }
 *   receiver: ss = Decap(myRkSec, ct);      (root', ck) = rootStep(root, ss)
 *             adopt peerRkPub = rk, and encapsulate to it on the next step

 * phone. So a flip only steps if the current sending chain has been used at
 * least once AND one of these thresholds is met; otherwise the reply continues
 * the existing chain, which costs nothing extra.
