// It lives in its own module, with no imports, for two reasons. `lib/config.ts`
// runs at import time before anything else and must not pull in `services/db`
// through `services/apns/api.ts`. And the whole point of extracting it is that
// it can be asserted in a unit test — the failure this replaces was a stack
// where push had never once been sent and nothing, anywhere, said so.
//
// ── Why the topics are in the required set ──────────────────────────────────
//
// `ApnsService.send` reads `APNS_TOPIC_IOS`/`APNS_TOPIC_MACOS` and returns
// silently when the one it needs is unset. A deployment with a valid key, a
// valid team and no topic therefore looks completely healthy and wakes nobody.
// "Configured" has to mean "can actually send", or the check is decoration.

// unsupported` — per message, as a stack trace, from inside a fire-and-forget
// send. That error says only "this is not a key I can decode"; it does not say
// which of the several ways the value can arrive went wrong.
//
// It can arrive as:
//   - a real PEM with real newlines          (APNS_KEY_P8_FILE → the mounted .p8)
//   - a PEM with literal \n escapes          (the one-line .env form)
//   - either of those with CRLF              (edited on Windows, or via a form)
//   - a PEM whose body lost its wrapping     (whitespace collapsed in transit)
//   - the base64 body alone, no armour       (someone stripped the header)
//
// Only the first two worked. The rest are indistinguishable at the call site
// and all produce the same opaque OpenSSL error, so this normalises every one
// of them into the armour OpenSSL wants rather than asking an operator to guess
// which transformation their secret went through.
