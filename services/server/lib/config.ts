// Centralized config loading, Docker-secret resolution, and fail-fast
// validation. This module is intentionally side-effecting at import time so it
// can run BEFORE any service module reads process.env. Import it FIRST in
// server.ts / bot.ts (`import "./lib/config"`).
//
// Load order matters:
//   1. dotenv  — fills process.env from a .env file (ENV_FILE overrides path).
//   2. _FILE   — resolves the Docker/compose "secrets" pattern: any FOO_FILE
//                env var is read from disk and its contents become FOO. This
//                lets compose mount secrets at /run/secrets/* without ever
//                putting the plaintext value in the environment or an image.
//   3. assertConfig(needs) — called explicitly by the entrypoint to fail fast.
//
// `needs` exists because the services no longer want the same things. Only
// app-api talks to Stripe; only push-bridge holds the APNs key. Demanding all of
// all would force every service to hold every secret, which is the opposite of
// what splitting them was for.

  // secret mounted into push-bridge ALONE. So auth and app-api saw two thirds of
  // a config, called it partial, and exited — on a box where push was set up

  // why a deployment can look healthy and have never sent a single push. The
  // check was right; the SCOPE was wrong. Nothing that cannot send has an
  // opinion about whether push is configured.
  //

  // no APNs at all is allowed to run, so exiting on HALF a config while
  // tolerating none of one is incoherent — and it is the worse outcome besides:
  // a crash-looping push-bridge takes out the health endpoint and buries its own
  // explanation in restart spam, on a box whose operator may need values from
  // the Apple Developer portal before they can fix it. Waking nobody is what
  // both states do; only one of them also drops the container.
  //

  // (and therefore Sentry) at boot, repeats the verdict on every broker connect,
  // and names the reason on the first wake it cannot perform.
