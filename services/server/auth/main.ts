// Auth server entrypoint (Phase 1 — see deploy/EXTRACTION_PLAN.md).
//
// Owns the HQC-KEM handshake that proves a client owns its public key, the
// admission gate, and token issuance. It replaces the WS AUTH_INIT/AUTH_CHALLENGE
// /AUTH_VERIFY flow from server.ts with stateless REST:
//
//   POST /auth/free/init    { pk }                -> { ct }         (KEM challenge)
//   POST /auth/free/verify  { pk, solution }      -> free session
//   POST /auth/paid/init    { pk }                -> { ct } or 403   (admission gate)
//   POST /auth/paid/verify  { pk, solution }      -> premium session
//   POST /auth/refresh (Bearer sessionToken)      -> { mqttToken, ttl } (rotation)
//   POST /mqtt/authn  (EMQX hook)                 -> { result }      (one-time token)
//
// `pk` is the full public key, and these routes are the ONLY place it enters the
// system: the server has to encapsulate to it, which nothing else in the stack
// does. Everything downstream — the session, the ACL, the topics, the broker's
// client id, `/mqtt/authn`'s username — names the caller by `peerId(pk)`
// instead. `/auth/*/verify` is where the two are tied together (DB.ensureUser),
// immediately after the KEM proof establishes that the caller holds the key.
//
// TWO DOORS, not one endpoint with a flag. Nothing is sold at either — the
// product is free and donation-funded — and on the default `open` policy both
// admit anyone who proves key possession. What separates them is what they
// MINT: the free door grants a bot-only session, the full door grants the whole
// friend graph. The split survives the paywall because it is what lets a client
// fall back instead of failing shut when a private (`allowlist`) server refuses
// it. The full door's wire name is still "paid"; nothing behind it costs money.
//
// Transport confidentiality is TLS (WSS via nginx) — there is NO per-connection
// AES session key here anymore (the SESSION_KEY step is deleted; TLS replaces it).
// Runs the SAME image as the monolith via `command:` in the compose overlay.

// Must be first: loads .env + resolves *_FILE secrets before anything reads env.
