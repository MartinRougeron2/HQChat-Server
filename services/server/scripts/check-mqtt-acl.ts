// Written during a bot outage that presented as a connect/drop loop with
// `0x87 NOT AUTHORIZED`. The reason code says why, and the bot now names the
// operation — but neither says whether the grant is missing or the topic string
// is wrong, and there is no `postgres` container to query by hand: the database
// is managed and its URL is a Docker secret this service already holds.
//
// So the check runs where the credentials are, and DERIVES what should be
// there rather than asking someone to eyeball a list. A missing row and a row
// that merely looks unfamiliar are very different problems.
//
// Read-only. `rebuild-mqtt-acl.ts` is the thing that fixes what this reports.
