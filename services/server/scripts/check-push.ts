// Written after "notifications only arrive while the app is open". Every step of
// the push path exits silently when it cannot proceed — no APNs config, no
// registered token, no bundle id — so a stack that has never sent a single push
// looks exactly like one that is working. This states which step stops.
//
// It must run in `push-bridge`: that is the only service mounted the APNs key,
// which is the whole reason the old all-or-nothing check in `lib/config.ts` had
// to be moved behind `needs.includes("apns")`.
//
// Read-only, and deliberately blind to one thing: whether the DEVICE is
// currently marked online. That lives in the bridge's memory, not the database
// — `GET /health` reports the size of that set. A token that exists here and a
// notification that never arrives, with APNs ready, means the bridge believed
// the device was reachable.
